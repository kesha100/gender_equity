          My vision for gender equity extends beyond simple equalityâ€”it's about creating a world where everyone has the 
          opportunity to reach their full potential, unrestricted by gender-based barriers or biases.

        <p>
          This vision encompasses not just workplace equality, but transformation across all aspects of society: from 
          education and healthcare to leadership and personal safety.

            Achieving this vision requires commitment and action from individuals, institutions, and communities. 
            It means challenging existing norms, advocating for policy changes, and creating inclusive spaces
